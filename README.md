# 🍪 Camcookie Gate

Camcookie Gate is a playful, branded access gate for websites.  
Instead of traditional logins, visitors interact with a simple image‑based challenge to unlock protected content.

## ✨ What It Does

- Presents visitors with a **3×3 image challenge**.  
- Requires solving the challenge **three times in a row** to pass.  
- Once passed, visitors are granted **temporary access** to hidden content.  
- Access lasts for a limited time before the gate reappears.  
- Provides **feedback messages** after each attempt.  
- Uses a **blue‑themed interface** with a logo and styled buttons.  
- Keeps protected content hidden until the challenge is cleared.

## 🎨 User Experience

- Visitors see a branded gate with a logo and challenge grid.  
- They **choose the correct images** to progress.  
- Success streaks are tracked and displayed.  
- After passing, the hidden section of the site is revealed automatically.  

## 🔒 Why It’s Useful

- Adds a layer of **security** without requiring accounts.  
- Prevents casual scraping or automated access.  
- Creates a **memorable, branded entry point** for your site.
